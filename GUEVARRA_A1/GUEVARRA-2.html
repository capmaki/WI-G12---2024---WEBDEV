    <h3>Name</h3>

    <h4>Group Name</h4>

    <p>
      The group's name was taken from the Tagalog word binibini which means
      "young lady", a nod to the group's vision to "embody the idea of a modern
      Filipina — <mark>sweet, fierce, independent, and informed</mark>."
    </p>

    <h4>Fandom Name</h4>

    <p>
      Fans of Bini are known as "Bloom(s)", commonly stylized as BL∞M(S) with
      the infinity symbol replacing the Os taking inspiration from the group's
      tagline Walo hanggang dulo (Eight until the end). The name serves as a
      lovely reminder of Bini's story and journey, it stands for the beginning
      of springtime that there's always beauty after every cold trial. It was

    <h3>History</h3>

    <h4>2018-2020: Formation through Star Hunt Academy</h4>
    <p>
      For many years, believing that "the Filipino talent has a place in the
      global stage," Laurenti Dyogi, ABS-CBN's Head of Entertainment Production,
      thought of forming a training camp where youth aspiring to become
      superstars "can develop or further hone their talents." In 2018, ABS-CBN
      finally launched the Star Hunt Academy program, which had 250 auditionees
      between the ages of 16 and 19 years old from all over the Philippines.
      From this pool of auditionees, in addition to recommendations by talent
      scouts, the first set of female Star Hunt Academy trainees were selected,
      which was originally composed of 11 girls. While Dyogi initially planned
      to debut a nine-member idol girl group, the 11 girl trainees were
      eventually trimmed down to eight girls: Maraiah Queen "Aiah" Arceta,
      Nicolette "Colet" Vergara, Mary Loi "Maloi" Ricalde, Gweneth 'Gwen" Apuli,
      Stacey Aubrey Sevilleja, Mikhaela "Mikha" Lim, Sheena Mae Catacutan, and
      Jhoanna Robles. Of the eleven members, two—Sheena and Gwen—were originally
      housemates from Pinoy Big Brother: Otso.
    </p>
    <p>
      The group was trained from 2018 to 2020 under local coaches including
      professional vocal coach and former chair of the Department of Voice,
      Music Theater and Dance at the University of the Philippines College of
      Music, Kitchy Molina, and Austrian-born dance coach Mickey Perz, as
      well as South Korean coaches from MUdoctor Academy.
    </p>
    <p>
      On August 3, 2019, the group as SHA trainees were initially introduced on
      the online pre-show of the PBB Otso Big Night, in which they first
      performed and were debuted as Star Hunt Academy trainees. They also
      performed in their first-ever mall show in Taguig and at least two ABS-CBN
      events. They also appeared in a 2019 National Youth Commission event,
      where they were proclaimed as Youth Ambassadors, and at the 2019 Manila
      Southeast Asian Games thanksgiving celebration.
    </p>
    <p>
      In May 2020, Dyogi released a performance practice video of the group
      singing and dancing to 'Ngiti' by Young JV and Gary Valenciano on Twitter
      to show their progress in training. In August 2020, the group participated
      in the Philippine Kpop Convention's Happy Hallyu Day 4 event, performing
      K-pop dance covers, including Red Velvet's In & Out, Blackpink's How You
      Like That and Twice's More & More.

      remake. In addition MU Doctor Academy collaborated with choreographers
      Moon Yeon-joo and Kwak Seong-chan, who formerly worked with popular K-pop
      groups, to create the choreography. On November 6, 2020, the official
